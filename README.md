# SmartEncryption

This is a library that provides a wrapper to the standard .NET encryption funtionality, put together in a way that is designedto make it harder to make mistakes. The library is opinionated, has minimal options, and is designed to do the right thing; this is done at the cost of flexability. This is the library you want to use if you arn't sure what the right way to do something is, but want it to be right.

## Status

The project is still in the design phase; no code will be written until there is a solid design.
